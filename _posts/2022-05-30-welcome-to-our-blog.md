We have been dreaming about this since we started our first line of code - starting our blog and share our experience and issues during our journey! So welcome to our blog and we hope you will find our posts useful or at least funny 😄
<!--more-->

Even though making blog is time consuming and sometimes not the priority number one, we want to at least capture our most important stuff and hopefully make this 
some kind of "habit" to update our blog as much as time allows 🙏

```csharp
if(ElixeumBlog.IsFinallyPublic)
{
  ElixeumBlog.SayHello(toWorld);
}
```
